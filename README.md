Let a citizen send a picture to the 112 dispatching, on invitation

Quick and dirty (really...), with a bit of security

1. The dispatcher sends a link by SMS to the caller.
2. The caller clicks on the link and take a picture.
3. The picture is sent to the server.
4. The server validates the data received (image and key).
5. The dispatcher refresh the page and see the pictures in reverse chronolocical order
